//what is Data Types in programming?
//In programming,data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement
//or processing.

//Typescript uses data types to know what kind of data is being stored and manipulated.
//For Example: you wouldn't store text in a variable meant for numbers,just like you wouldn't put
//water in a photo album.

//Here are some basic Data Types in Typescript.
//String:For textual data.
//Number: for numerical values (integars and floating-point numbers)
//Boolean:For True/Flase Values.
//Any:For variables that can hold any type of data.

// This is the code
let text: string = "khaskheli"; //string
console.log(text);
let num: number = 99; //number
console.log(num);
let bool: boolean = true; //boolean
console.log(bool);
let other: any = "http:www.google.com"; //any
console.log(other);

// let text1:string=99;   //this error is because string cant print number and same condition for number.
// let num2:number="ali";  //number Data Type can't print textual data.
